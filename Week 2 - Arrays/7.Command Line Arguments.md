- So far, all of your programs have begun pretty much the same way.
  
  ```c
  int main(void) {}
  ```
  
- Since we’ve been collecting user input through inprogram prompts, we haven’t needed to modify this declaration of main(). 
  
- If we want the user to provide data to our program before the program starts running, we need a new form.  
  
 - To collect so called command-line arguments from the user, declare main as:
 
 ```c
 int main(int argc, string argv[]) {}
 ```
 
 - These two special arguments enable you to know what data the user provided at the command line and how much data they provided. 
 
#### argc (argument count) 

  - This integer-type variable will store the number of command-line arguments the user typed when the program was executed.

#### argv (argument vector)

- This array of strings stores, one string per element, the actual text the user typed at the command-line when the program was executed. 

- The first element of argv is always found at argv[0]. The last element of argv is always found at argv[argc-1]. 
 - Do you see why?  
 
- argv (argument vector) 
 - Let’s assume the user executes the greedy program as follows!
