When you choose to “step over” while debugging, the debugger will execute the current line of code and pause on the next line, without entering any function calls that might be present on the current line.

```js
function addNumbers(a, b) {  
  let result = a + b;  
  return result;  
}  
  
let x = 5;  
let y = 10;  
// If you "step over" below line, you will not enter the 'addNumbers' function.  
let z = addNumbers(x, y);
```
