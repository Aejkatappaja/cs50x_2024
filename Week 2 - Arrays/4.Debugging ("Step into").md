When you choose to “step into” while debugging, you are instructing the debugger to enter the code of the current line if it is a function call. The debugger will pause the program’s execution at the first line of the called function, allowing you to examine the code inside that function.

```c
function addNumbers(a, b) {  
  let result = a + b;  
}  
  
let x = 5;  
let y = 10;  
// If you "step into" below line, you will enter the 'addNumbers' function.  
let z = addNumbers(x, y);
```
