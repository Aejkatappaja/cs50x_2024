The code calculates the Scrabble score for two players' words and determines the winner based on the scores. To understand how the points are computed with the syntax `score += POINTS[word[i] - 'A']`, let's break it down step by step.

### Breakdown of the Point Calculation

1. **Character to Index Mapping:**
    
    - The variable `word[i]` represents the character at the `i-th` position of the string `word`.
    - `word[i] - 'A'` or `word[i] - 'a'` converts the character to an index that can be used to access the `POINTS` array.
2. **ASCII Value Manipulation:**
    
    - In ASCII, characters are represented by numeric values. For example, 'A' is 65, 'B' is 66, and so on. Similarly, 'a' is 97, 'b' is 98, etc.
    - By subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' or 'a', we get the position of the letter in the alphabet (0-based index). For example:
        - For 'A': `word[i] - 'A'` becomes `65 - 65` which is 0.
        - For 'B': `word[i] - 'A'` becomes `66 - 65` which is 1.
        - For 'a': `word[i] - 'a'` becomes `97 - 97` which is 0.
        - For 'b': `word[i] - 'a'` becomes `98 - 97` which is 1.
3. **Accessing the POINTS Array:**
    
    - The `POINTS` array is defined as `int POINTS[26]` and contains the Scrabble points for each letter from A to Z.
    - By using the index obtained from `word[i] - 'A'` or `word[i] - 'a'`, we can access the corresponding point value from the `POINTS` array.

### Example:

Let's go through an example for better understanding:

- Suppose the word is "Cab".
- The POINTS array is defined as `int POINTS[26] = {1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10};`.

For each character in "Cab":

- 'C':
    
    - It's uppercase, so use `POINTS[word[i] - 'A']`.
    - `word[i] - 'A'` is `67 - 65` which is 2.
    - `POINTS[2]` is 3.
    - Add 3 to the score.
- 'a':
    
    - It's lowercase, so use `POINTS[word[i] - 'a']`.
    - `word[i] - 'a'` is `97 - 97` which is 0.
    - `POINTS[0]` is 1.
    - Add 1 to the score.
- 'b':
    
    - It's lowercase, so use `POINTS[word[i] - 'a']`.
    - `word[i] - 'a'` is `98 - 97` which is 1.
    - `POINTS[1]` is 3.
    - Add 3 to the score.

The total score for "Cab" is 3 + 1 + 3 = 7.
