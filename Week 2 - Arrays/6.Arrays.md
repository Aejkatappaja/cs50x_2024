- Arrays are a fundamental *data structure*, and they are extremely useful! 

- We use arrays to hold values of the same type at contiguous memory locations. 

- One way to analogize the notion of array is to think of your local post office, which usually has a large bank of post office boxes.

- In C, the elements of an array are indexed starting from 0. 
	- This is one of the major reasons we count from zero! 

- If an array consists of n elements, the first element is located at index 0. The last element is located at index (n-1). 

- C is very lenient. It will not prevent you from going “out of bounds” of your array; be careful! Arrays 

#### Array declarations 


```c
type name[size];
```

```c
int student_grades[40];
```

```c
double menu_prices[8];
```

- The `type` is what kind of variable each element of the array will be. 

- The `name` is what you want to call your array. 

- The `size` is how many elements you would like your array to contain. 


- If you think of a single element of an array of type *data-type* the same as you would any other variable of type *data-type* (which, effectively, it is) then all the familiar operations make sense. 
  
  ```c
  bool truthtable[10]; 
  
  truthtable[2] = false; 
  if(truthtable[7] == true) 
  { 
  printf(“TRUE!\n”); 
  } 
  truthtable[10] = true; 
  ```
  
- When declaring and initializing an array simultaneously, there is a special syntax that may be used to fill up the array with its starting values. 
  
  ```c
  // instantiation syntax 
  bool truthtable[3] = { false, true, true };  
  //or
  bool truthtable[] = { false, true, true }; 
  
  // individual element syntax 
  bool truthtable[3]; 
  truthtable[0] = false; 
  truthtable[1] = true; 
  truthtable[2] = true;
  ```
  
  
- Arrays can consist of more than a single dimension. You can have as many size specifiers as you wish.
  
  ```c
  bool battleship[10][10];
  ``` 
  
- You can choose to think of this as either a 10x10 grid of cells. 
  - In memory though, it’s really just a 100-element one dimensional array. 
  - Multi-dimensional arrays are great abstractions to help visualize game boards or other complex representations.
    
- While we can treat individual elements of arrays as variables, we cannot treat entire arrays themselves as variables. 
  
- We cannot, for instance, assign one array to another using the assignment operator. That is not legal C. 
  
- Instead, we must use a loop to copy over the elements one at a time. 
  
  ```c
  int foo[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; 
  int bar[5]; 
  ~~bar = foo;~~ 
  ```
  
  ```c
  int foo[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; 
  int bar[5]; 
  
  for(int j = 0; j < 5; j++) 
  { 
  bar[j] = foo[j]; 
  }
  ```
  
-  Recall that most variables in C are *passed by value* in function calls. 
  
- Arrays do not follow this rule. Rather, they are *passed by reference.* The callee receives the actual array, *not* a copy of it. 
  - What does that mean when the callee manipulates elements of the array? 
    
- For now, we’ll gloss over why arrays have this special property, but we’ll return to it soon enough! 
  
  void set_array(int array[4]); 
  void set_int(int x); 
  
  ```c
  int main(void) 
  { 
  int a = 10; 
  int b[4] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 }; 
  set_int(a); 
  set_array(b); 
  printf(“%d %d\n”, a, b[0]); 
  } 
  
  void set_array(int array[4]) 
  { 
  array[0] = 22; 
  } 
  
  void set_int(int x) 
  { 
  x = 22; 
  } 
  ```
  
  `10, 22`
