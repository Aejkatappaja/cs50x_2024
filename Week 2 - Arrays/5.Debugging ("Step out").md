When you choose to “step out” while debugging, the debugger will continue the program’s execution until it exits the current function. It allows you to skip the remaining lines of the current function and return to the caller’s context.

```js
function multiplyNumbers(a, b) {  
  let result = a * b;  
  return result;  
}  
  
function addNumbers(a, b) {  
  let sumResult = a + b;  
    
 // If you "step into" here and then "step out," you will return to this line.  
  let product = multiplyNumbers(a, b);    
  return sumResult + product;  
}  
  
let x = 5;  
let y = 10;  
  
// If you "step out" here, you will return to where 'addNumbers' was called.  
let z = addNumbers(x, y);
```
