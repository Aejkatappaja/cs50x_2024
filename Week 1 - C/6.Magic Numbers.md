- Some of the programs we’ve written in CS50 have some weird numbers thrown in there. 

  - The height of Mario’s pyramid is capped at 23, for example. 

- What do those numbers mean? If someone looks at your program, is the meaning of 23 immediately obvious? 

- Directly writing constants into our code is sometimes referred to as using magic numbers.

```c
card deal_cards(deck name) 
{ 
	for (int i = 0; i < 52; i++) 
	{ 
	// deal the card 
	} 
}
```

- We’ve got a magic number in here. Do you see what it is? 
  - More importantly, do you see a potential problem here? Particularly if this function is just one of many in a suite of programs that manipulate decks of cards.

```c
card deal_cards(deck name) 
{ 
	int deck_size = 52;
	for (int i = 0; i < deck_size; i++) 
	{ 
	// deal the card 
	} 
}
```

- This fixes one problem, but introduces another. 
  - Even if globally declared, what if some other function in our suite inadvertently manipulates `deck_size`. Could spell trouble.
    
- C provides a preprocessor directive (also called a macro) for creating symbolic constants.

- At the time your program is compiled, #define goes through your code and replaces `NAME` with `REPLACEMENT`. 

- If #include is similar to copy/paste, then #define is analogous to find/replace. #define NAME REPLACEMENT Magic Numbers

card deal_cards(deck name) 

{ 
	for (int i = 0; i < DECKSIZE; i++) 
	{ 
	// deal the card 
	} 
}
