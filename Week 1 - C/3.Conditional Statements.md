● Conditional expressions allow your programs to make decisions and take different forks in the road, depending on the values of variables or user input. 

● C provides a few different ways to implement conditional expressions (also known as branches) in your programs, some of which likely look familiar from Scratch. 

### Conditionals 

```c

if (boolean-expression) 
{ 

} 
```

  • If the `boolean-expression` evaluates to `true`, all lines of code between the curly braces will execute in order from top-to-bottom. 

  • If the boolean-expression evaluates to false`, those lines of code will not execute.
 
 ```c
  if (boolean-expression) 
  { 
  
  } else 
  { 
  
  } 
  ```
  
  • If the `boolean-expression` evaluates to `true`, all lines of code between the first set of curly braces will execute in order from top-to-bottom. 
  
  • If the boolean-expression` evaluates to false, all lines of code between the second set of curly braces will execute in order from top-to-bottom.

 ```c
 int x; 
 if (expr) 
 { 
 x = 5; 
 } 
 else 
 { 
 x = 6; 
 }
 ```
 
 ```c
 int x = (expr) ? 5 : 6;
 ```
 
 
 • These two snippets of code act identically. 
 
 • The ternary operator (`?:`) is mostly a cute trick, but is useful for writing trivially short conditional branches. Be familiar with it, but know that you won’t need to write it if you don’t want to. 
 
 `if (and if-else, and if-else if-…-else)` 
 ● Use Boolean expressions to make decisions. 
 
 `switch` 
 ● Use discrete cases to make decisions. 
 
 `?:` 
 ● Use to replace a very simple if-else to make your code look fancy.
