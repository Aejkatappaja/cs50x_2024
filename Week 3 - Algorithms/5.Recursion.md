• We might describe an implementation of an algorithm as being particularly “elegant” if it solves a problem in a way that is both interesting and easy to visualize. 

• The technique of *recursion* is a very common way to implement such an “elegant” solution. 

• The definition of a recursive function is one that, as part of its execution, invokes itself.

• The factorial function `(n!)` is defined over all positive integers. 

• `n!` equals all of the positive integers less than or equal to `n`, multiplied together. 

• Thinking in terms of programming, we’ll define the `mathematical function n! as fact(n)`.

```c
fact(1) = 1 
fact(2) = 2 * 1 
fact(3) = 3 * 2 * 1 
fact(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 
fact(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ...
```

```c
fact(1) = 1 
fact(2) = 2 * fact(1) 
fact(3) = 3 * 2 * 1 
fact(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 
fact(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ...
```

```c
fact(1) = 1 
fact(2) = 2 * fact(1) 
fact(3) = 3 * fact(2)
fact(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 
fact(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ...
```

```c
fact(1) = 1 
fact(2) = 2 * fact(1) 
fact(3) = 3 * fact(2) 
fact(4) = 4 * fact(3) 
fact(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ...
```

```c
fact(1) = 1 
fact(2) = 2 * fact(1) 
fact(3) = 3 * fact(2) 
fact(4) = 4 * fact(3) 
fact(5) = 5 * fact(4)
```

```c
fact(n) = n * fact(n-1)
```

• This forms the basis for a *recursive definition* of the factorial function. 

• Every recursive function has two cases that could apply, given any input. 
   • The base case, which when triggered will terminate the recursive process. 
   • The recursive case, which is where the recursion will actually occur.

```c
int fact(int n)
{ 
  if (n == 1) 
  { 
    return 1; 
  } 
  // recursive case 
}
```

```c
int fact(int n)
{ 
  if (n == 1) 
  { 
    return 1; 
  } else 
  {
    return n * fact(n-1);
  }
}
```

```c
int fact(int n)
{ 
  if (n == 1) 
	  return 1; 
  else 
	  return n * fact(n-1);
}
```

• In general, but not always, recursive functions replace loops in non-recursive functions. 

• Example implementation with loop: 

```c
int fact2(int n)
{ 
  int product = 1;
  while (n > 0) 
	  {
	     product *= n;
	     n--;
	  } 
	  return product;
}
```

• It’s also possible to have more than one base or recursive case, if the program might recurse or terminate in different ways, depending on the input being passed in.

• *Multiple base cases:* The Fibonacci number sequence is defined as follows: 
	• The first element is 0. 
	• The second element is 1. 
	• The n th element is the sum of the (n-1) th and (n-2) th elements. 
	
• *Multiple recursive cases:* The Collatz conjecture.

• The Collatz conjecture is applies to positive integers and speculates that it is always possible to get “back to 1” if you follow these steps: 
	• If n is 1, stop. 
	• Otherwise, if n is even, repeat this process on n/2. 
	• Otherwise, if n is odd, repeat this process on 3n + 1. 
	• Write a recursive function collatz(n) that calculates how many steps it takes to get to 1 if you start from n and recurse as indicated above.

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

#include <stdio.h>

  

int collatz(int n);

  

int main(void)

{

int result = collatz(6);

printf("%i", result);

}

  

int collatz(int n)

{

  

if (n == 1)

return 0;

  

bool is_even = (n % 2) == 0;

  

if (is_even)

return 1 + collatz(n / 2);

  

else

return 1 + collatz(3 * n + 1);

  

return 1;

}
