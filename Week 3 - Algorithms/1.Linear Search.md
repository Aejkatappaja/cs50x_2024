• In linear search, the idea of the algorithm is to iterate across the array from left to right, searching for a specified element. 

*In pseudocode*: 
• Repeat, starting at the first element: 
  • If the first element is what you’re looking for (the target), stop. • Otherwise, move to the next element.

• Worst-case scenario: We have to look through the entire array of n elements, either because the target element is the last element of the array or doesn’t exist in the array at all. 

• Best-case scenario: The target element is the first element of the array, and so we can stop looking immediately after we start.
