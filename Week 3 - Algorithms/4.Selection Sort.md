• In selection sort, the idea of the algorithm is to find the smallest unsorted element and add it to the end of the sorted list. 

*In pseudocode*:
• Repeat until no unsorted elements remain: 
  • Search the unsorted part of the data to find the smallest value 
  • Swap the smallest found value with the first element of the unsorted part.

  • Worst-case scenario: We have to iterate over each of the n elements of the array (to find the smallest unsorted element) and we must repeat this process n times, since only one element gets sorted on each pass. 
  
  • Best-case scenario: Exactly the same! There’s no way to guarantee the array is sorted until we go through this process for all the elements.
