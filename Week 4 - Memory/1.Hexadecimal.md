• Most Western cultures use the decimal system, aka base-10, to represent numeric data. 

`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1`

• As we know, computers use the binary system, aka base-2, to represent numeric (and indeed all data). 

`0 1`

• As computer scientists, it’s useful to be able to express data the same way the computer does. 

• The problem, of course, is that trying to parse a huge chain of 0s and 1s can be quite difficult.

• The hexadecimal system, aka base-16, is a much more concise way to express the data on a computer’s system.

`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f`

`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F`

• Hexadecimal makes this mapping easy because a group of four binary digits (bits) is able has 16 different combinations, and each of those combinations maps to a single hexadecimal digit.

• Just like binary has place values (1, 2, 4, 8…) and decimal does too (1, 10, 100, 1000…), so does hexadecimal.

• To convert a binary number to hexadecimal, group four binary digits (bits) together from right to left. 
	• Pad the leftmost group with extra 0 bits at the front if necessary. 
	
• Then use the chart a few slides back or your memory to convert those bits to something a bit more concise.
