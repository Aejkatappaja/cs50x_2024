• Pointers provide an alternative way to pass data between functions. 
	• Recall that up to this point, we have passed all data by value, with one exception. 
	• When we pass data by value, we only pass a copy of that data. 

• If we use pointers instead, we have the power to pass the actual variable itself. 
	• That means that a change that is made in one function can impact what happens in a different function. 
	• Previously, this wasn’t possible!
	
• Before we dive into what pointers are and how to work with them, it’s worth going back to basics and have a look at our computer’s memory.

• Every file on your computer lives on your disk drive, be it a hard disk drive (HDD) or a solid-state drive (SSD). 

• Disk drives are just storage space; we can’t directly work there. Manipulation and use of data can only take place in RAM, so we have to move data there. 

• Memory is basically a huge array of 8-bit wide bytes. 
	• 512 MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB…

• Back to this idea of memory as a big array of byte-sized cells. 

• Recall from our discussion of arrays that they not only are useful for storage of information but also for so-called random access. 
	• We can access individual elements of the array by indicating which index location we want. 
	
• Similarly, each location in memory has an address.

• There’s only one critical thing to remember as we start working with pointers:

# *POINTERS ARE JUST ADDRESSES !*

• As we start to work with pointers, just keep this image in mind:

• A pointer, then, is a data item whose 
	• value is a memory address 
	• type describes the data located at that memory address 
	
• As such, pointers allow data structures and/or variables to be shared among functions. 

• Pointers make a computer environment more like the real world.

• The simplest pointer available to us in C is the NULL pointer. 
	• As you might expect, this pointer points to nothing (a fact which can actually come in handy!) 
	
• When you create a pointer and you don’t set its value immediately, you should always set the value of the pointer to NULL. 

• You can check whether a pointer is NULL using the equality operator 
( `==` ).

• Another easy way to create a pointer is to simply extract the address of an already existing variable. We can do this with the address extraction operator (`&`). 

• If x is an int-type variable, then `&x` is a pointer-to-int whose value is the address of `x`. 

• If `arr` is an array of doubles, then `&arr[i]` is a pointer-todouble who value is the address of the `i` th element of arr. 
	• An array’s name, then, is actually just a pointer to its first element – you’ve been working with pointers all along!

• The main purpose of a pointer is to allow us to modify or inspect the location to which it points. 
	• We do this by *dereferencing* the pointer. 

• If we have a pointer-to-char called `pc`, then `*pc` is the data that lives at the memory address stored inside the variable pc.

• Used in this context, `*` is known as the dereference operator. 

• It “goes to the reference” and accesses the data at that memory location, allowing you to manipulate it at will. 

• This is just like visiting your neighbor. Having their address isn’t enough. You need to go to the address and only then can you interact with them.

• Can you guess what might happen if we try to dereference a pointer whose value is NULL?

`Segmentation fault`

• Surprisingly, this is actually good behavior! It defends against accidental dangerous manipulation of unknown pointers. 
	• That’s why we recommend you set your pointers to NULL immediately if you aren’t setting them to a known, desired value.
	
## `int* p;`

• The value of `p` is an address. 

• We can dereference `p` with the `*` operator. 

• If we do, what we’ll find at that location is an int.

• So what happens?
